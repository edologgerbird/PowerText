analysis-demo,School,12d97cr,RedditTokStories,1680755914.0,"me and my friend Jeremiah were in a group with two girls from class today, and i did something relatively unforgivable.

I started making fun of him a little bit in front of them, because to be honest, these girls were somewhat decent looking kind of.

So he said ‚ÄúYo bro, what are you doing?‚Äù

And my stomach dropped. He looked pissed off as balls. I stepped back and laughed, saying i had to go to the mens bathroom.

I strutted down the hall as i heard Jeremy follow me towards the bathroom.

Gosh darnit, this is not good.

I sprinted into the bathroom and found that 20 people were standing in there vaping. 

I began to plead with the freshman around me for just one single hit from their glorious precious vapes.

‚ÄúDrop and give us 20, loser.‚Äù Requested the underclassmen.

I immediately dropped to my hands and knees on the bathroom floor, and begun banging out pushups like a madman. 

Just as i reached my 18th, children cheering me on, Jeremy entered the bathroom and undid his belt. Urging me to rise to my feet.

‚ÄúOoooooooooooo‚Äù said everyone all at once somehow.

‚ÄúYou have done me wrong, bro.‚Äù He said, 
i winced as i rose to my feet, arms weak.

‚ÄúNo, it was only for those girls!‚Äù I pleaded.

He cracked his belt.

‚ÄúYou broke the bro-code, bro.‚Äù 
The dreaded words dangled from his open mouth and rattled between my ears.

He dove into a raging assault, whacking me in the limbs with his leather whip.

I cried out in agony as i dropped to my knees, the final blow knocking me to my core.

‚ÄúYou have chosen this fate, remember that.‚Äù Threatened Jeremy as he opened the bathroom window.

The freshman carried me to him over their heads, in that moment i felt like a martyr. A beaautiful fallen warrior of combat.

And then, jeremy commanded his henchmen to release me from the second story bathroom window.

I shouted as my limp corpse flopped out of the building and into gods hands.

I landed safely and decided to walk home. Thats how i got here to tell you guys this epic tale.

But rest assured, i am okay. And i will never get thrown from the bathroom ever again, on my watch.",1680762333

TLDR: I have a teacher who uses forms of visual media to teach instead of teaching the lesson himself, and I don't know which basis I'm receiving perfect scores on. He also didn't respond to one of my emails asking what was happening on a day I was gone from his class.

As the title implies, I have a teacher who I feel straight-up refuses to teach the class.

I am currently in the third trimester of my sophomore year of high school, and one of the classes I have this trimester is Global Studies II. The class usually starts with the teacher having the class find and share news pertaining to current events, which I personally enjoy. After everyone is done sharing and he is done commenting on the news is where things start to get irritating.

He doesn't stand up in front of the class and teach the lesson. Instead, he would give us a piece of visual media pertaining to our current topic of discussion (news article, video, comic, map, etc.) and just have us answer questions based off of that. 

And before I hear some of you argue that this teacher is teaching, but just in a way that I don't like: By using visual media to teach, it's the news article or video that we're watching that's doing the teaching, and not him. 

What makes this a bit more concerning:

1) I currently have a 100% (A) in this class, but I don't know if that's because I'm turning stuff in or if I'm answering questions correctly. He also has not given me any written or oral feedback as to how I'm doing in the class.

2) This somewhat resembles a story I saw in a Reddit thread a few years ago of a Redditor who had a math teacher who would write problems on the board, then sit down and play video games on his computer. This teacher obviously doesn't do that, but he has given all of my assignments thus far perfect scores and I don't know what basis they are on.

The icing on the cake is that one day, I was gone from school performing at an All-State Speech Festival, and I had emailed all of my teachers, including this one, asking what we were doing in class that day. The only teacher that didn't email me back or otherwise give me any indication of what was happening in class that day was the Global Studies II teacher. As a result, I only got to watch the last 10 minutes of an hour-long documentary we were watching about Russia putting down dissent in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

I plan to finish the class given how well I'm doing, but is this something I can talk to my principal about? 

Oh, and if this adds anything, this teacher is also the Varsity football coach.",1680762333

___

THE BEST ADVICE IS: 

* APPLY AND RENEW EARLY. 
* ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PASSPORT'S EXPIRATION DATE. 
* PUT YOUR PASSPORT IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE WHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT. 
* DO NOT WAIT TO CHECK EXPIRATION OR LOCATION OF PASSPORT THE NIGHT BEFORE. CHECK IT EARLY.

#American Passport Information 

## How to Apply

[All Information can be found here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html).

There will be a form to fill out. Information on passport photos. What documents & IDs you'll need, etc.

##Where to Apply

[Then you'll need to see which avenue you'll need to apply at](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/where-to-apply.html). This could be an acceptance facility like a local USPS office, an actual Passport Agency, or via mail (for renewals).

[If you are applying Outside of the US please see this information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html).

NOTE: Many locations still have COVID protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins. 


##Processing Times Within the US
As of Late March 2023, times have been extended.

[You can find the latest processing times here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html).

Normal processing is around 10-13 weeks.

Expedited processing is around 7-9 weeks. (You also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility, that is an added cost is an additional add-on to Expedited passports.)

Urgent processing within 3 business days. And you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date if you've not applied before. If you have you can only call within 5 business days of your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.

Life or Death/ Emergency Service is around 72 hours/3 business days, and you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.

NOTE: This timing may not include shipping time. There have been issues in the past of USPS causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times.

NOTE: Some facilities may be quicker, others may take longer, the above time is the average. We have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate. Do not book travel ""to the day"" of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport, because again, it does not include shipping times.

NOTE: It can take up to 2 weeks before your status changes to ""In Process"".

**Some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than stated times BUT NOT ALL. Do not plan on being lucky, get your application in early and expedited as needed.**

**Many people are saying that both Normal and Expedited processing is taking weeks longer than the above-listed processing time.**

#Frequently Asked Questions for Applying Within the US

### What is the status of my application?

Check here: https://passportstatus.state.gov/

### They cashed my check, does that mean my passport is coming soon?

No. During covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first, and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to 2-6 weeks. Them cashing the check doesn't mean they are processing it or that everything is going well. 

Once they start processing it, if they find errors, or your paperwork, IDs, etc aren't in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues.

### Can I get a same day passport.

Not likely during covid since they aren't taking walk in appointments.

### My trip is in a few days and I just realized I don't have my passport/it's lost/it's expired/whatever, HELP WHAT DO I DO?

In all honesty you are pretty much SOL. [It is almost impossible to get the Urgent/Life or Death/Emergency in-person appointments](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/emergencies.html). For these urgent appointments you must call them directly via the phone numbers on the above link. If you are trying to go that route you'll need to look at any location you can realistically get to INCLUDING flying to them. 

Note that many people have faked life or death/emergency reasons so this is making it nearly impossible to get these appointments.

Otherwise you may be better off calling all your pre-booked vacation expenses and see if you have any options to postpone or refund your now-not-happening-trip. 

### Can I switch my application from Regular Processing to Expedited? 

Yes. Expedited service costs an additional $60. If you applied and have not received your passport, you may call the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 and receive instructions on how request to expedite your passport. 

NOTE: It can take 20 days to fulfill this request.

NOTE: This is just a request, sometimes it cannot be honored. Regular Passports are processed at a different facility than Expedited ones. So they need to FIND your application paperwork in order to be able to switch the processing. 


### I submitted my passport ages ago but my status hasn't changed/its been WAY past the processing times quoted on the website.

There may be a problem. Try contacting the State Department/Passport Office, or reach out to your state State Representatives. They actually can often help with speeding along passports and fixing issues when they get stuck in the system.

### My ""Status"" on the website says ""Not Available""

It can take up to 2-6 weeks for your status to change to In-Progress.

### How do I find my State Representatives who can assist me?

[This link will help you for your State House Represenative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) or [you can also try your Senator](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm). Once you are in contact and have asked for help on your passport application you may be asked to fill out a privacy form or other paperwork allowing your representative to work on your behalf. Make sure to follow up quickly to keep the ball rolling.

### Can I buy a flight that shows I'm leaving within 3 business days, get my passport, and then cancel the flight/Can I fake a family emergency? 

No, you'll need to provide proof of your emergency. 

### Can I buy a flight that shows I'm leaving in 2 weeks, book the Urgent in-person appointment that would be within 72 hours of that flight, get my passport, and then cancel the flight? 

Yes, but given that those appointments are still supposed to be for urgent/emergencies and right now those appointments are VERY hard to get even if you have a valid reason.

For those doing these in-person appointment, you'll get your passport within a few hours or a day or two from the appointment. They'll factor in your urgency, what wiggle room you have, and the other needs to figure out what priority yours will be. But you will get it within 72 hours.

### What about using a 3rd Party Rush/Expediting Service/Courier/Expeditor?

DO NOT USE THESE!!!

There is no magical service (other than contacting your state's house of representatives) that can get you your passport quicker than official channels. You are instead paying a shit ton of money for someone else to do any of the above steps and faster processing isn't guaranteed or possible. As well as there are many outright scam companies out there. I would not recommend you give them your personal information. [See the official government info here on why you should not use these](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/courier-and-expeditor-companies.html).

### I'm an American currently abroad and my passport recently expired. I need to quickly return to USA, can I travel on an expired passport?

Not any longer this ended December 31st, 2021.

## Other Questions

### Can I travel internationally by air without a passport book?

For air travel, the airline won't even let you on your first initial flight if you do not have proper documentation and visas. This is because the airline will be penalized and fined if you are held and deported due to improper documentation/visas. 

A passport card cannot be used for air travel.

### Can I travel internationally by land without a passport?

We frequently get questions on this especially for the USA/Mexico border. Officially no, you actually do need a passport. Unofficially some people have reported getting INTO Mexico without a passport can be easier than coming BACK into the US without a passport.

### Can I travel internationally via a cruise without a passport?

We'd recommend hitting up /r/cruise as it may depend on your specific cruise. Some may not allow you on at all without a passport, others simply won't let you do shore excursions if you don't have a passport.

### I have dual citizenship, can I travel on my other passport instead?

While USA has no exit immigration, so you don't need to show your passport to exit, you are required to enter the USA on your American passport. You cannot use your other citizenship to get a visa to enter America on your other passport. So unless you are going to get your passport abroad at an Embassy/Consulate before you return, get your American passport before you go.


### What is the difference between a Passport Book and a Passport Card?

Card is for Land borders and some sea ports of entry. Think Canada, Mexico, Caribbean, Bermuda. You cannot use it for air travel.

If you plan on doing any air travel within the next 10 years get the passport book.

### Since US Embassies are processing passports faster (less than 6 weeks), how can I send my application there to be processed?

You can't. Embassies only process passports for people in-person and in-country. 

Also, if your travel is soon and you are headed back to the US, you'll be given a limited-use Emergency Passport that can only be used to travel back to the US.

So the ""Why don't I just fly to Mexico on my soon to be expiring passport and apply at the embassy there?"" idea only works if you are in Mexico for 6+ weeks and if you have a current valid passport to even enter Mexico (or insert whatever other US Embassy you were asking about.)

### I've heard about ""6 Month Validity Rule"" what is it and what does it mean?

Some countries require the passport to still be valid 6 months after entry (or exit). This is to ensure you have valid documents to be able to exit the country. Some countries do not have this requirement, some require it to be 3 months, etc.

But the easiest way to think about it is your passport actually expires 6 months early. And so its best to renew it before that time.


### I lost my passport, reported it lost, and now just found the original one, can I travel on it?

No. Once reported lost/stolen its deactivated and cannot be used for travel. You should put a hole through a corner of the passport or otherwise make it clear it cannot be used so you don't accidentally bring it to the airport.

### I lost my passport, but have a photo copy. Am I okay to travel?

NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


### I got part of my order but didn't get my old passport/new passport/passport card/my ID documents?!?

They'll come in separate shipments.


### I forgot my passport was in my maiden name/former name. Can I still use it for travel?

Your ticket must match your passport name. 

Note: There may be issues if your vaccine card/info is in a different name than the passport/ticketed name, but use the COVID Megathread for that question. 


### How can I get flight confirmation/book a flight if I don't have my passport? 

Unless you are booking with a 3rd party agency that charges for every little change, pretty much all airlines allow you to book with nonsense numbers (all 1's) and at a later time update your passport info, or even wait until check in, in-person to do so.

Many people do not have passports when they book flights, or they lose their passport, or their passport expires. They are fully aware that until they check the passport day-of, the information might not be correct or valid.

# ONE KEY RULE:

If you are answering any question with timing of how long it took you to get your passport you MUST state when this happened.",1680762333
analysis-demo,travel,jdix4ay,jadeoracle,1679683329.0,"As expected based on the last few years, the Late Feb through July passport rush has occurred.

We are in the period where last minute Spring Break travelers are trying to get a passport or realized theirs is lost/missing/expired. Additionally, people trying to get ahead of summer travel are seeking passports. 

**The passport agency has increased the processing times yesterday (the second time in 2 months).** 

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/politics/blinken-state-department-passport-delays/index.html


**Since most people don't read the wall of text above (you should) the bottom line is without shipping it'll likely take you between 2-5 months** to get your passport depending on which processing method you chose. Expect those that are in process currently to also have delays, and that the processing times likely will continue to increase. **So the times listed by the agency are NOT TO BE TRUSTED.**

**Note that the ""Urgent"" in-person appointments are hard to come by. Yes, you only need proof of travel, usually a flight (a fully refundable one will work) within 14 days for people who've not applied yet (although some people are saying within 5 days if you had already applied) and that is the only other option available to most people.** However, those appointments are limited, do not allow walk ins, and you may need to fly to another location to get one. Do not assume you'll be able to get an appointment, as this ""hack"" is known and everyone else is doing it, which results in the passport phone number to be a busy signal or dropping calls.

2/26. At 11:30pm I saw that I could no longer update my contact/shipping information in the online system which was a huge glimmer of hope. 

2/27.    
I call NPIC and get through at 8am PST after busy signals and dropped calls. After a couple of holds and extra checks, the customer service rep offers me an in-person appointment in Honolulu. I waffle for about 15 seconds and then she says, oops ‚Äì it‚Äôs gone now. She is unable to give me any status update on my online application, but agrees that if I can‚Äôt update the contact info, it‚Äôs likely on its way but that she can‚Äôt say when it will arrive. She confirms that if I miss my Saturday flight, I need to have a new flight in order to get an in-person appointment which is highly annoying. 

I send my congressional reps an update email after the call (I have been corresponding with them since last Tuesday). They respond saying that they will check on my online passport and look for appointments in LA and San Francisco. 

I call NPIC again and get through at 11am. The lady goes puts me on hold so she check something else and returns with 3-4 appointments on Friday (the day before my flight leaves) in Seattle, the mecca for wayward passport applicants. I choose one (immediately! lol) and she tells me that I can have only one appointment at a time, so I need tell the congressional reps to stand down or I run the risk of losing the Seattle appointment if they get me one locally. I send them an email after the call.    
 

My plan is book a refundable ticket to the passport agency and hope that my online passport arrives before I leave so I can cancel my appointment and flight.

**Takeaways**: I think that something special does happen when you're 5 days out from travel. During both of my calls, I was put on at least one additional hold and I heard one of the customer service reps reviewing my application submission date and expedited status to herself. I called a couple times when I was 8-12 days out and they would always tell me there was nothing available and to call back when I was five days out.  So don't lose hope completely if you can't get an in-person appointment when you're less than 14 days out. When you're 5 days out, keep calling. My plan was to repeatedly call throughout the day - luckily I got mine during my second call with NPIC.

My congressional representatives weren't able to get me an in-person appointment, but there's a good chance they moved my online application along. Definitely reach out to them and send them a copy of your flight itinerary with that privacy form. I contacted mine at 12 days from travel and wish that I had started the process at 3 weeks from travel.

Also try and be pleasant on the calls. I get how frustrating it is, but ranting and raving won't help you. (I saved that for this thread. haha)

Good luck everyone and safe travels.

ETA. Wow - so get this. Both congressional offices sent me emails like 8 minutes after I posted this coming through with Friday appointments at my local (Los Angeles) passport agency. I've officially cancelled my Seattle appointment and heading over there as 5 miles away is much better than 900 miles. The congressional rep was super chill about it too - ""oh we always get appointments. When they couldn't print yours, you were given an automatic in-person appt."" I still can't believe it. Moral of the story is GET THOSE CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES INVOLVED!",1680762333

I submitted my online application for renewal on 1/6 with expedited processing, and submitted my preschooler‚Äôs first-time application in-person on 1/13 with expedited processing. Hers came in the mail on 2/9. We have an international flight booked for 3/4.    

**Mon 1/9**   

Received notice that my online Passport Application Number XXXXXX is being reviewed by US Dept State employee with an expedited processing time of 3-5 weeks.


**Mon 2/20**    

Federal Holiday. MyTravelGov shows that passport is in ‚ÄúIn Process Status‚Äù with under 2 weeks until international travel.


**Tues 2/21**    

Attempted to call National Passport Information Center at 5am PST to make an Urgent Travel Service appointment since my flight was less than 14 days, but got a busy signal for 5 hours. Finally spoke to a representative at 10:30am PST after being put in the 45 minute wait queue for online passport applications (the wait queue for in-person applications was 4 minutes). Spoke to 3 different people and was told that in-person Urgent Travel appointments for online applicants could only be scheduled within 5 days of travel.  They noted my travel date. I went on the MyTravelGov portal to update my shipping to expedited on the guidance of one of the representatives.    

10:00am. First contact with the offices of Senators Feinstein and Padilla, and Representative Ted Lieu for assistance ‚Äì I emailed them their privacy forms, my flight information, passport application number, and application submission date at. Followed up with phone calls where I left messages for Padilla and Lieu and actually spoke to a person at Feinstein‚Äôs office. She told me she had 30 people in the same boat and was going to check on the status of my application. Got an email from Lieu‚Äôs office at 2:30pm saying they were going to investigate. (Never heard from Padilla‚Äôs office)


**Wed 2/22**    

Received 2 forwarded emails (at 1:18pm and 2:06pm) from the National Passport Information Center, courtesy of Rep. Lieu‚Äôs office. Application is being processed at the New Orleans Passport Agency (they took 2/21 off for Mardi Gras) and the Rep‚Äôs office has alerted the agency of the urgent need. I thanked the congressional staff member and let them know of the 5-day stipulation for in-person appointments and he said that he will be notified when passport is printed before it is shipped, that he would get me an in-person appointment if needed, and that he is monitoring my file.    

Tried to check my application to see if I could change my address (on the hunch that if you are unable to do so, your passport is in its final stages and ready to ship), but the site was so buggy and I could never get the One Time Password. Called the passport website tech support (also someone in here said that they think that might have done something to speed the process along haha), and they helped me trouble shoot (use Chrome in an incognito window, use a different browser, delete cookies, etc.). Tech person confirmed that yes, when you are unable to modify your shipping, passport is ready to ship out. 


**Thurs 2/23**    

Site is still really buggy. Can‚Äôt get on to check my status. Call NPIC ‚Äì not giving me an appointment. No change in status. Made childcare arrangements with family in case I had to fly across the country the following week for an in-person appointment.


**Fri 2/24**    

At 2pm Senator‚Äôs office said they‚Äôre trying to get me an appointment in San Francisco and to hold on tight. I take a nap and dream that I have an appointment. Wake up, no update from Senator. No change in online status.


**Sat 2/25**    

No change in online status.


**Sun 2/26**    

Draft emails to send to my congressional representatives while I‚Äôm on hold with the NPIC on Monday at 5am PST. Decide to check online status because I‚Äôm a masochist. At 11:39pm instead of being able to change my passport address I get the magic ‚ÄúThank you for your online passport book/card renewal application.‚Äù Proceed to freak the fuck out. 


**Mon 2/27**    

Officially at the 5 days before travel mark.    

6:43am. (slept through my 5am alarm :/) Call NPIC after 2 rounds of busy signals. Get through at 8am. After a couple of holds and extra checks, she offers me an in-person appointment in Honolulu. I waffle a bit and then she says, oops ‚Äì it‚Äôs gone now. She is unable to give me any status update on my online application but agrees that if I can‚Äôt update the contact info, it‚Äôs likely on its way but that she can‚Äôt say when it will arrive. She confirms that if I miss my Saturday flight, I need to have a new flight in order to get an in-person appointment which is highly annoying. But there are no appointments anywhere.    

8:37am. I send congressional reps an email begging for help. They both respond with 2 hours saying they will check on online passport and look for appointments in LA and San Francisco.    

9:32am. I call NPIC again after 11 rounds of busy signals. Get through at 11am. The lady goes puts me on hold so she can check something else and returns with several appointments on Friday 3/3 (the day before my flight leaves) in Seattle, the mecca for wayward passport applicants. I choose one and she tells me that I can have only one appointment at a time, so to tell the congressional reps to stand down or I run the risk of losing the Seattle appointment if they get me one.    

11:30am. I send an update to the congressional reps telling them to focus on pushing the online application through and that I have an in-person appointment. My plan is to book a refundable ticket to Seattle and hope that my passport arrives in time so I can cancel my appointment and flight.    

2:14pm. I receive an email from my Rep‚Äôs office saying that my passport will not be processed in time at New Orleans, so he‚Äôs booked a 7:30am appointment for me the day before my flight at the Los Angeles agency. 6 miles away is much better than 900 miles away so I gratefully cancel the Seattle appointment.    
  
2:48pm. My Senator‚Äôs office also has an appointment for me at Los Angeles (I cancel that one since I already have one from the Rep.).


**Tues 2/28**    

8:50am. I get an email from my Senator‚Äôs office saying that my online passport has been processed and she sends me a tracking number (?!).


**Wed 3/1**    

11:15am. Passport arrives via UPS Express mail from the New Orleans Passport Agency. I cancel my in-person appointments at the Los Angeles agency. 


1:45pm. Online system still reads my passport as In Process (eyeroll).


**Sat 3/4**    
 
Bon voyage!


**TAKEAWAYS**   
* Get in touch with your representatives.  I wish that I had done it 3 weeks out from travel, but they were able to help in ways that NPIC was not (local passport agency appointments, for example).    
* Try and be pleasant with the NPIC people. Rant and rave on here. :)    
* I really think magic stuff happens when you're 5 days out. Try not to freak out until then.

analysis-demo,travel,12c4uzu,Kananaskis_Country,1680660369.0,"There have been quite a few questions regarding Tourist Visas for Vietnam on this forum lately, so here's an update, including a big change regarding expedited Visas which just changed in the last couple of days.

**1.)** Visa on Arrival (VOA) hasn't existed for ages now so the only option for most tourists is the E-Visa. It's good for 30 days and one entry. That's it. If you want to visit longer then you have to do a Visa run to Laos, Cambodia, etc. and pick up a fresh E-Visa, then reenter Vietnam.

**2.)** [Here is the official government website for the E-Visa application.](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/trang-chu-ttdt) It's a straightforward application that costs $25 USD and usually takes 3 - 5 business days to process, but submit your application with plenty of spare time because sometimes it takes longer and you can't board the aircraft to Vietnam without it. Lastly, don't use 3rd Party Vendors for the application, they offer no advantage over the official website.

**3.)** [Here are the countries that are eligible for the E-Visa.](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/documents/20181/117155/Vietnam-Evisa-nation-list.pdf/21e0f88f-d8a0-48b8-bfdb-a0f82b0853e2) If your country doesn't make the list then you have to apply for a paper Visa from the nearest Embassy, sorry.

**4.)** [Here is the list of airports, land and sea entry points that accept the E-Visa.](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/documents/20181/117155/List-of-evisa-port.pdf/c774e24b-1ab8-4fb6-9ac1-dcdfaccecf8e)

**5.)** Visa Exemption: A few nationalities are afforded the luxury of Visa Exemption. The time period varies from 14 days to 90 days. All you need is proof of onward travel and you're good to go. There are about [25 lucky nationalities with this perk.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Vietnam) (And yes, you can enter on an E-Visa, then leave, then return using your Visa exemption or vice versa.)

**6.)** Expedited Services: Lastly, up until last week it was possible for a poorly prepared traveller to get an expedited E-Visa via some of the excellent 3rd Party Vendors that provide Visa services. [These guys are one of several examples.](http://vietnamvisapro.com/) There has been a new government crackdown on these services and expedited E-Visas by 3rd Party Vendors does NOT exist at this time.

**Bottom line:** Use the official government website and submit your application with plenty of spare time and you'll find that entering Vietnam with an E-Visa is simple and straightforward.

Happy travels.
