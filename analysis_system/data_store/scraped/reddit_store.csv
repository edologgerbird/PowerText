machinemind,Machine Learning,jega9ag,colincameron49,1680293657.0,I have 0 experience with machine learning but looking to solve a problem I have and wondering if ML might not be the solution. Looking for some guidance on tools and how to get started on the project as quickly as possible. I work in agriculture and some portion of my time is reviewing pesticide labels for certain attributes. I have tried different document parsing platforms but the labels between manufacturers are all slightly different so structure has been hard to nail down. The other issue is I am specifically looking for certain key words in these documents as my company sells products that can be paired with pesticides to make them work better. I am hoping to build a workflow where I could drop a PDF into a folder have software spit out some sort of structure surrounding ingredients and instructions while flagging the keywords. I am decently proficient in no-code platforms if one such exists for my problem. Thanks in advance for any guidance. If this is the wrong subreddit for this I also apologize.,1680761132

At this point I'm just teaching it the language - not worrying about further abilities such as Q&A, I expect that to be later with fine-tuning. Anyway, my dataset is currently a csv with \[id, text\] and each text is a paragraph.

It is my understanding that only 512 characters/tokens are going to be fed in (depending on my max\_length, but my point is that it'll probably be less than the entire length of the paragraph), and beyond that will be ignored. If I were to break the paragraphs into 512-word chunks, I could make better use of the dataset. But most likely those subsequent chunks wouldn't start a phrase or sentence - it'd be starting in the middle of a sentence.

Hi everyone,

My friend and I are building a platform that allows you to host a ChatGPT website within your own network - whether it's in an organization or at home!

The benefits include:

* Monitoring for DLP scenarios / employee needs
* Getting back control of current AI platforms
* Preventing users from bringing their own accounts
* Deploying within your network

&#x200B;

Future Plans:

* Easier deployment process using Beanstalk / K8s
* Integrate with existing DLP solutions / advanced DLP capabilities
* Enable prompt sanitization
* Enable SIEM features
* Build internal corpus for prompts / responses

Come check it out and please give us any feedback! We are working with some decision makers in the community and would love to share this with the broader audience.

Cheers,

machinemind,Machine Learning,12c7wqi,Radiant_Routine_3183,1680667821.0,"Greetings. I recently came across a Twitter by Yann LeCun that sparked an interesting idea. He shared a Nature article ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01516-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01516-2)) that suggests human brain neurons may have hierarchical structures to track long-range context. Considering the limitations of current LMs in making basic logic errors and lacking long-range logical reasoning, could Hierarchical Transformers or similar architectures be a solution?

I found a recent paper from OpenAI and Google that demonstrates the possibility of Transformers learning higher-order representations of text:[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13711.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13711.pdf)

Could this be a potential solution to improve the Long-Range Logic Reasoning in LMs? What are your thoughts on this?

Edit: In broad terms, the way I understand Hierarchical Transformers is that they not only learn low-level representations for short-term predictions but also higher-level representations for long-term predictions. It's somewhat reminiscent of Yann LeCun's concept of Hierarchical JEPA, as mentioned in his article 'A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence'",1680761132

Of course there are certainly architectures able to optimize that much more, but if true there is also merit in the approach that says ""we have all we need, slap more layers and GPU to this"". 

I would love to see a way to stack transformers that would merge tokens. Maybe a simple addition could do the trick? On some layers, divide the context size by k by simply adding tokens n, n+1,... n+k and you should get a hierarchical representation of the data.",1680761132

Technically they are more or less equivalent since you can transform between the two with a linear function.

Practically, cosine similarity is bound between -1 and 1, while Euclidean distance is unbounded towards infinity. This behavior is suboptimal with most models due to risk of overflow.

Also, nth root calculation for Euclidean is more costly than dot product for similarity.",1680761132
machinemind,Learn Machine Learning,jf31uqy,olavla,1680719521.0,"Per ChatGPT-4:

Cosine similarity is often preferred in comparing transformer embeddings over other distance metrics like Euclidean distance for a few reasons:

Scale invariance: One of the main advantages of using cosine similarity is that it is scale-invariant. This means that it measures the similarity between vectors regardless of their magnitudes. In NLP tasks, the magnitude of the vectors might not always be directly related to the meaning or relevance of the text. Cosine similarity focuses on the angle between vectors, which helps mitigate this issue.

Robustness to different text lengths: Although the magnitude of transformer embeddings may not necessarily increase with the length of the text, longer texts still tend to have higher magnitudes due to the aggregation of information. By using cosine similarity, we can better handle cases where the text length varies significantly, as the angle between vectors is less sensitive to such variations.

Interpretability: Cosine similarity values range from -1 to 1, which provides an intuitive and interpretable measure of similarity. A value of 1 means that the vectors are identical, 0 means they are orthogonal (unrelated), and -1 means they are diametrically opposed. This simplicity makes cosine similarity easier to understand and communicate compared to other distance metrics.

Suitability for high-dimensional spaces: In high-dimensional spaces, the Euclidean distance between points tends to increase as the dimensionality increases, leading to a phenomenon called the ""curse of dimensionality."" Cosine similarity is less affected by this problem, as it focuses on the angle between vectors rather than their absolute distance. Transformers create high-dimensional embeddings, so using cosine similarity can be more appropriate in such cases.

Precedent in NLP: Cosine similarity has been successfully used in various NLP tasks and models (e.g., tf-idf, word2vec, doc2vec, etc.). This established usage may contribute to its popularity and preference when working with transformer embeddings as well.

In summary, cosine similarity is preferred for comparing transformer embeddings primarily because it is scale-invariant, robust to different text lengths, interpretable, suitable for high-dimensional spaces, and has a precedent in NLP applications. However, it's essential to consider the specific problem and requirements when choosing the appropriate distance metric, and in some cases, other metrics like Euclidean distance might be more suitable.",1680761132
machinemind,Learn Machine Learning,jf5fdxg,wise0807,1680757642.0,"Good question. Cosine similarity is simply the cosine angle 📐 formed by two vectors. You get this by calculating the dot product and dividing by the length of the vectors. - A.B/(A^2)*(B^2). This makes the model optimize for the meaning of the text (direction of vectors) rather than the exact words or sentence structure, giving it the ability to generalize. If we used the rmse error term, we would optimize for exact sentence structure and words and it would not generalize well. Also when I said vector that includes tensors as well.",1680761132

I'm in a similar situation according to what you wrote in another comment above. I'm on a mission to never be manipulated or deceived ever again. EVER again.

In addition to NLP, get into body language. The Definitive Guide to Body Language by Allen and Barbara Pease is a good place to start. After that, dive into the work of Chase Hughes. The Six Minute X Ray (take your time with that one) is great and so is every video and podcast he's on. Chase says it's best to learn to recognize truth signals rather than deception tells and that makes sense. But why not both? 

There's also several other body language books but I'm not familiar with them yet. Body Language by Julius Fast is an OG.

After that, I would recommend Paul Ekman's work, but I personally haven't gotten into his books yet, they just seem promising.

There's a couple other books that seemed worth reading that are sitting on my shelf, but I haven't dived into just yet.

Never Be Lied to Again by David J Lieberman, and Spy the Lie by Houston, Floyd, and Carnicero

Also, people have mentioned boundaries and I think that is exactly where you should put your focus on to begin with. While I don't have any recommendations for that per se, The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem by Nathaniel Brandon will help with that, especially the chapter on personal integrity.

I recently came to the realization that stress (and possibly, deeper, my personality) is playing against me. Noticed because I went away for a couple of days, left my dog with someone, and I saw my dog much more calm than I knew him (buddy who took care of him has a ‘super chill attitude’). I learned that my dog shook his head quite often as a sign of stress..

Well, I’m in my 30s and raising a baby boy sonI don’t want him to be affected with this in the way my dog is. In general, might be affecting the relationship with my wife as well. Me taking it all so serious and being stress.

Long story short… I want to be very chill, not take it all so serious and don’t feel stressed (too much to ask, I know). But to truly, a deep and real change. 

Not looking for a magic answer. Just curious of this is something that could be achieved through NLP?

Thanks for reading!",1680761132
machinemind,Neuro-Linguistic Programming,jee967x,Lumpy-Blacksmith-272,1680263127.0,"Yes .NLP can definitely help. A couple of routes you could take.  

Get a couple books on it and go through them and actually do all the exercises as you go.  Watch YouTube videos on specifically which are you want help with nlp in the search.

You could take online or in person practitioner training for yourself, and as you learn, it go through all the exercises.

You could schedule a NLP session with a NLP Practitioner to address one specific item. You can see amazing results in a one hour session.

You could do a day breakthrough session with an NLP master practioner.

Depending on your financial situation and how important change is, a single session can greatly help.

Understand you can change, you have to make a decision to change, and NLP is an amazing and powerful method to do it.

For example, Fear at best gives you Power to make decisions and at worst, gives you PTSD. It is how we use our emotions and program them to work for us and not against us. 

It is good to see you are willing to improve yourself. And Yes, you can definitely achieve this through NLP Coaching or by becoming an NLP Practitioner.

So what NLP does is it makes us consciously aware about the shortcomings of our unconscious mind and helps us to work on it. Once, those shortcomings are corrected, it then again becomes part of the unconscious mind and that is when we are the best versions of ourselves...",1680761132
machinemind,Neuro-Linguistic Programming,jeetz45,EliteHypnosis,1680273041.0,"Well done for both realizing you need assistance, and also being open to seeking it out.

I am an NLP Practitioner, and also an Ericksonian Hypnotist (Milton Erickson was one of the original three models for NLP), and a question I have for you to explore now is this:

Do you remember when in your life you first noticed yourself feeling/being stressed? Or as you notice certain patterns in yourself now, how far back to you remember having those patterns? For some people it can go way way back, or alternatively they can appear more recently due to some life change..",1680761132
machinemind,Neuro-Linguistic Programming,jeeu3n8,SapioTist,1680273091.0,"Yes it can. And you can do plenty work on it yourself. The value of working a practitioner is that they can help you thru the blind spots that will be harder for you to discover without external input. Often, the things we need to work on can be glaringly apparent to others, while we are so entrenched in our own perceptual reality that we take these behaviors and reactions as a natural part of life. Kind of like sending your dog to your friends house did. You noticed difference, and the benefit of making change, only after external input. 

Working on these areas alone is like walking into the darkness and hoping to find what you need when you're not even sure what that is. Having someone to help navigate the room can at least send you in the right direction without running into every obstacle on the way. You'll still need to do work of feeling around on the wall for the light switch, but it sure helps when they can help get you across the room without breaking a toe in the process.",1680761132

machinemind,Neuro-Linguistic Programming,jehwilh,WanderingSchola,1680320447.0,"Hi, not an NLP practitioner here, but I have an opinion to throw in. Stress is kind of the symptom of lots of different things:

* Poor self organisation 
* Disorganised/stressful work or home environment
* Nervous system dysregulation from not completing the stress ""cycle""
* Nervous system dysregulation from (C-)PTSD
* Excess stress from belief in stress as inherently negative 
* Lack of resources (fitness, rested-ness, mindfulness) to deal with stressful situations.
* Social stress from things like stigma, poverty, or disability which all affect resource access and expenditure

While NLP can help with some of these (probably through behaviour and belief modification), it's not going to fix all of it.

machinemind,Neuro-Linguistic Programming,jek1p2h,ozmerc,1680368355.0,"There is physiological stress and psychological stress. It flows as follows. Perceived stressors create psychological stress which in turn trigger physiological stress like raised cortisol and elevated blood pressure.

Your perception of stressors changes over time. Psychologically or consciously you may become habituated to a stressor but physiologically you're anchored into the initial response like raised cortisol levels. You no longer perceive the different physical symptoms so on level you are not stressed. You just call the elevated cortisol levels the ""new"" you. It's your new normal.

A pet or child have heightened sensory perception to ensure they survive in the environment within which they reside. Through pheromones and micro-muscle cues from you they are assessing how to make meaning of their surroundings. 

They won't recognize the stressors as they are not stressors to them. Nor do they have an expectation which is being challenged to identify something as a stressor.

They will however match your physiological responses as they are modeling that it's the best way to survive in this environment.

So with all this said what do you do?

Explore not what stresses you but rather what you feel are your preferences. ""I prefer x"". ""I would rather do x"". Over time when stressors get habituated you develop preferences and a lifestyle to work around them or get through them. You make slight changes to your behaviors and logically explain those changes away. 

These little tolerances or annoyances are now just your ""lifestyle decisions"". They are your opinions or preferences. These subtleties offer a wealth of opportunity for personal transformation.

Start your exploration here and then use many of the NLP tools out there to address what needs to be addressed.",1680761132

The closest competitor for HJK this season perhaps are FC Honka from Espoo, who they are facing today.
